Contour plots
=============

A combination of three variables, as well as wind vectors and location markers,
could be plotted by PostWRF.

.. note::
   Line colors, font sizes, etc., can be modified by changing the relevant variables in **namelist.wrf**

Example 1
==========

**Two line contours plus the locations of some points
(specified in 'Data extraction' section of namelist.wrf):**

Example 2
==========

**Shaded contour of a polynomial (tk * (rh/100)^2)**

During the processing, several questions, such as the color pattern of
the contours, name and unit of the polynomial, and file format will be asked from the usr.

The user can specify a pressure level for each variable names, with exactly
the same number as the variable names (2 values, corresponded to tk and rh for this example).
If only one value is set for *3rd_Variable_pressure_level*, all the variables
(tk and rh) will be plotted at the same pressure level.
