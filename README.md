# PostWRF

### Visualization and postprocessing of the WRF and ERA5 data

**Plot the WRF and ERA5 data, in the same simple way as you run the WRF model!**

PostWRF is a bunch of interactive tools, written in NCL and Bash scripts, to visualize and post-process the WRF model outputs (as well as ERA5 and RTTOV data, to some extent).

PostWRF is useful for both the expert and less-experienced users. Students can plot the WRF and ERA5 outputs whithout struggling with coding and syntax errors. Expert users can also carry out common postprocessing tasks in a simple and straightforward way.
